' I want you to create and submit a file called results.md which you talk about the results of executing your code. Talk about the differences in execution time between the two versions of the linear functions, the two versions of the binary functions, and the difference in execution time of linear vs. binary searches. Also, talk about the difference in execution time when the code is run with debugging symbols -g vs. with optimizations. This file will be 50% of your grade for this assignment.  '

## Result Linear
**# Two Version of the linear function
> The time for two versions of the linear was over one second it 

## Result Binary
** Two Version of the Binary function

## linear vs. binary searches  

When the program is using optimizations it was running fast
